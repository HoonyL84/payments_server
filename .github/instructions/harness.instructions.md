# Harness Template Instructions

Use this file as a path-scoped companion to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

When working in this repository:

- Treat `AGENTS.md` as the top-level instruction index.
- Treat `docs/project/PLANS.md` as the project goal source.
- Treat `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md` as the architecture and coding rule source.
- Treat `docs/design-docs/memory-governance.md` as the memory update contract.
- Prefer the task loop: plan, implement, verify, commit (and push when a remote exists), complete, then commit completion metadata (and push when possible).
- If adding a reusable skill, create `skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter.
